The Data folder consists of 2 subfolders: Post, combined and Pre, raw and the Data info file.
- The Pre, raw folder consists of two subfolders: polllution and weather, where each contains the sutiable reports for each of the municipalities. These datasets are raw and don't have
any preprocessing done on them. The pollution datasets are retrieved from pulse.eco API and the weather datasets are retrieved from the Dark Sky API.
- The Post, combined folder consists of three subfolders: pollution, weather and combined. The pollution and weather folders contain reports which are results of the DataAggregationPipeline
notebook from the Data preprocessing notebooks and the combined folder contains combined reports(weather+pollution) for each of the municipalities.
- The Data info file contains information for each of the attributes of both reports alongside some other useful information.
