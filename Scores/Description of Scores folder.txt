- The scores folder is generated by the ModelEvaluation pipeline notebook. It consists of 3 subfolders: models, plots and sumbissions alongisde
the scores.csv file. 
- The models subfolder contains saved models which were trained on a certain window. If they were used to predict the last X hours from the
dataset for the certain municipality then they were trained on Data[:X,predictors] data. Models are saved using jotlib library.
- The plots subfolder contains a plot for each of the trained models in the models subfolder. The plot shows the predicted trend of the PM10 var 
vs the actual trend for the last X hours which the models are predicting.
- The submissions folder contains predictions only from the best model in the models subfolder in the format row:PM10_prediction
- The scores file contains the MAE(mean absolute error) from each model in the models subfolder
